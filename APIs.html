            At the beginning of my journey to learn APIs, I explored various resources. 
            Mostly, I prefer to learn from books, which is why I searched online for a book and found 
            one titled <cite>Django for APIs</cite> <strong>by William S. Vincent</strong>. The reasons for me to  choose
            this book were:
            <ul>
                <li>I was already interested in Django and the scope of this book focused on Django.</li>
                <li>This book was specifically written to help beginners, addressing the lack of good resources available 
                for developers new to the Django REST Framework.</li>
                <li>It also includes many projects, and the author has made the code publicly available on GitHub (in case reader couldn't solve it)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>LEARNING:</h3>
        <p>I found that in recent years an "API-first" approach has emerged as arguably the dominant paradigm in web 
        development. This approach involves formally seperating the back-end from the front-end.</p>
        <p>
            This paradigm of web-developement is "Future proof" because a backend API can be consumed by any JavaScript
            front-end(when the current front-end Framework eventually replaced by even newer ones in the years to come, the 
            back-end API can remain the same) not only that when one expand from web to mobile app the change is only  the 
            front-end part we don't have to redesign the whole backend architecture for the newer frontend by simply attaching 
            with the API.
        </p>

          <h3><dfn>Serilization</dfn> </h3>
          A serializer translates data into a format that is easy to consume over the internet, typically JSON, 
          and is displayed at an API endpoint. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Why Serializers are Important?
          <ul>
          <li>APIs talk using JSON (or other formats).</li>

            <li>Django models are Python classes, not JSON.</li>

            <li>Serializers translate between these two worlds.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Types of Serializers in DRF

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>Meaning</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>serializer.serilizers</td>
              <td>manually define field</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>serializer.ModelSerilizer</td>
              <td>automatically define a field based on model</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>What Happens</ul>  
          <li>Serialization	Python object ➔ JSON (send to client)</li>
          <li>Deserialization	JSON ➔ Python object (receive from client)</li>
          <li>Validation	Check if input data is valid (correct types, formats)</li>
          <li>Saving	If valid, create/update the model in the database</li>
        </p>

<h3><dfn>Generics</dfn></h3>
In Django REST Framework (DRF), generics are a set of views that provide common functionality for working with API endpoints. They simplify the creation of common API views, such as listing, creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting resources. DRF provides a range of generic views for these operations, allowing developers to quickly create RESTful APIs without writing repetitive code.

What are Generics in DRF?
Generics are class-based views that come pre-built with common behaviors for handling standard database operations like retrieving, updating, and deleting model instances. These views are built on top of DRF's APIView and provide convenient methods to simplify CRUD operations.

There are several generic views provided by DRF, and you can use them directly or extend them to meet your needs.

Types of Generics in DRF
Here are the main generic views available in DRF:

ListCreateAPIView:

Used for displaying a list of model instances and creating new ones.

Provides functionality for GET (list of objects) and POST (create new object).

RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView:

Used for retrieving, updating, and deleting individual model instances.

Provides functionality for GET (retrieve object), PUT/PATCH (update object), and DELETE (delete object).

<ol>
<li>ListAPIView:</li>

Used for displaying a list of model instances.

Provides functionality for the GET method (list objects), but doesn't support creating new objects.

<li>CreateAPIView:</li>

Used for creating new model instances.

Provides functionality for the POST method (create object), but doesn't support listing or modifying objects.

<li>RetrieveAPIView:</li>

Used for retrieving a single model instance.

Provides functionality for the GET method (retrieve object), but doesn't support creating or modifying objects.

<li>DestroyAPIView:</li>

Used for deleting a single model instance.

Provides functionality for the DELETE method (delete object), but doesn't support listing or creating objects.

<li>UpdateAPIView:</li>

Used for updating an existing model instance.

Provides functionality for PUT/PATCH (update object), but doesn't support listing or creating objects.</ol>
