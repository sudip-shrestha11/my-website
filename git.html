                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In this blog post, I'll share how I came to learn about Git and GitHub version control, and 
                    how they helped me create more efficient workflows. Initially, I focused on improving repetitive 
                    and iterative tasks—particularly the way I used to update the blog section of 
                    my website—gradually transforming those steps into smoother, more fluent, and less time-consuming processes.</p>

                <h2>Catalyst</h2>
                <p>The incident that led me to start using Git and GitHub was getting a new laptop. 
                    After purchasing it, I realized I couldn't easily access the folders I previously used to manage my website content. 
                    That’s when I discovered GitHub — it allowed me to clone my repository and make my project accessible from any device, 
                    anytime.As I explore more about them I found that it makes my previousl steps more effecient. let's see how:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The steps I used to follow to update my blog section were quite manual. First, 
                        I would modify or create a file, then log into the hosting site, delete the existing file (if I was making a modification), 
                        and upload the new one. After learning Git and GitHub, this process became much simpler — now, 
                        I can make changes directly from my VS Code editor using the terminal, and update everything with just a few Git commands.</p>

                        <h2>My First Interaction with Git</h2>
                        <p>
                            This blog I am writing was published through Git which was my first Interaction. The command I used:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>git add git.html</code></pre>
                        <pre><code>git commit -m "Update blog section with new post"</code></pre>
                        <pre><code>git push origin main</code></pre>
                    
                        <p>
                            I even moved image files into subfolders using simple commands like:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>mv photo.jpg asser/</code></pre>
                    
                        <p>
                            These basic Git commands opened the door to a more streamlined, version-controlled development process. What started as a problem became the spark that introduced me to a powerful new tool—and I haven’t looked back since.

                <h2>The Power of Collaboration</h2>
                <p>One of the most exciting aspects of GitHub is the ability to collaborate with other developers. Through pull requests, I was able to contribute to other people’s projects, and they reviewed my work. It felt incredible to work together with people from all around the world.</p>
